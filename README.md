# Jarvis
<br />
## Problem Statment:
<br/> We are In the world of Technology. Where every thing is considered as binary either true or false. Now a days we have many virtual assistance such as 
                  google assistance, alexa, siri but everything has its own positives and negatives. By using that virtual assistances we cant automate the tasks that we 
                  generally do on our day to day basis such as sending a mail, sending the whatsapp message and  opening any desktop application and reading the content
                  of the website and Handling Word documents and the PDFs and Many More things...<br /><br />
**Solution:**<br /> We have come up with the Python Desktop Application named as Jarvis. which has exactly all the functionality that we have in the existing virtual assistances.
          and addition to that we have added the functionalities that user performs on daily basis and repeatedly.
              
<br /><br />
Jarvis is basically a virtual assistant for the desktop or a laptop. as we know google assistant is best for the Android devices.
but we don't have same for a desktop.We have for desktop such as siri and cortana. but everything has advantages and disadvantages
<br /><br />
Jarvis automate the task that generally a desktop user does repeatedly such as 
<br /><br />
1.Opening a particular Application(such as Notepad,WebBrowser,Games)
<br /><br />
2.It includes Online Searching same as any other virtual assistant does
<br /><br />
3.Desktop Automation(Opening a specific folder on request)
<br /><br />
4.Playing a specific or random Music stored on the system
<br /><br />
5.Web Automation for sending the whatsapp Messages(it automatically sends the whatsapp messages)
<br /><br />
6.Web Scraping for Reading the content of the website(such as news or stories)
<br /><br />
7.Sending the mail to specific mail id specified by user by using the system environmental variables
<br /><br />
8.Knowing the time, weather and can perform any mathematical Calculations
<br /><br />
9.Currency Convertor
<br /><br />
10.And the last one Daily dairy Writing
<br /><br />
**Technologies Used:**
<br /><br />
1.Python

2.Selenium (pip  install selenium)(for web automation)

3.Autoit (pip install autoit)(for desktop automation)

4.pyttsx(pip install pyttsx)(for text to speech)

5.SpeechRecognition(pip install SpeechRecognition)(for recognition the words said by user)

6.wikipedia(pip install wikipedia)(for getting the content from wikipedia)

7.wholframalpha(pip install wholframalpha)(for mathematical caculations and technical searches)

8.email(pip install email)(uses smtp(simple mail transfer protocol))

9.bs4(pip install bs4)(beautifulsoup for webscraping i.e getting the data from website)
(before doing webscraping see robot.txt file of te website)

10.requests(pip install requests)(used to request the webpage as bs4 is used to extract data from it)

11.CurrencyConvertor (pip install CurrencyConvertor)(used for currency conversion)

12.click(pip install click)(used to click a specific option in web automation)

**Many more features that can be added to it suchas**

1.Image Recognition

2.Speaker Recognition(for authenticate purpose) 

3.Adding Machine Learning Algorithms to write the code automatically when the problem
statement is given.

4.Google Translations(Making Jarvisfor all the langauges)

5.Linking the smart devices such as AC,TV,Speakers to the Jarvis.
